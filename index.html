                <h2>Lettermark Logos</h2>    
                <p>A Monogram or lettermark is a typography-based logo that's compromised of a few letters, usually a company's initials. The lettermark is all about simplicity. 
                
                By utilizing just a few lettermark logos are effective at streamlining any company brand if they have a long name.</p>
                <div class = 'photo-container'>
                    <img src = ''>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Wordmark Logos</h2>
                <p>Similar to a lettermark, a wordmark or logotype is a font-based logo that focuses on a business' name alone. Think Visa and Coca-Cola. Wordmark logos work really well when a company has a succinct and distinct name. Google's logo is a great example of this. The name itself is catchy and memorable so, when combined with strong typography, the logo helps create strong brand recognition.</p>
                <div class = 'photo-container'>
                    <img src = ''>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Pictorial Mark Logos</h2>
                <p>A pictorial mark (sometimes called brand mark or logo symbol) is an icon or graphic-based logo. It's probably the image that comes to mind when you think "logo": the iconic Apple logo, the Twitter bird, the Target bullseye. Each of these companies' logos is so emblematic, and each brand so established, hat the mark alone is instantly recognizable.
                
                A true brand mark is only an image. Beacuse of this, it can be a tricky logo type for new companies, or those without strong brand recognition, to use.</p>
                <div class = 'photo-container'>
                    <img src = ''>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Abstract Mark Logos</h2>
                <p>An abstract mark is a specific type of pictorial logo. Instead of being a recognizable image--like an apple or a bird--it's an abstract geometric form that represents your business. A few famous examples include the BP starburst-y logo, the Pepsi divided circle and the strip-y Adidas flower.

                Like all logo symbols, abstract marks work really well because they condense your brand into a single image. However, instead of being restricted to a picture of something recognizable, abstract logos allow you to create something truly unique to represent your brand.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>Mascot Logos</h2>
                <p>Mascot logos are logos that involve an illustrated character. Often colorful, sometimes cartoonish, and most always fun, the mascot logo is a great way to create your very own brand spokeperson. 
                
                A mascot is simply an illustrated character that represents your company. Think of them as the amabassador for your business. Famous masctors include the Kool-Aid Man, KFC's Colonel and PUB's cute Walter Wally.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>Combination Logos</h2>
                <p>A combination mark is a logo compromised of a combined wordmark or lettermark and a pictorial mark, abstract mark, or mascot. The picture and text can be laid out side-by-side, stacked on top of each other, or integrated together to create an image.
                
                Beacuse a name is associated with the image, a combination mark is a versatile choice, with both the text and icon or mascot working together to reinforce your brand.</p>
